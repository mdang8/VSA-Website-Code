    <p style="font-size:16px"><strong>READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY!</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome Map Diem players. Congratulations for "discovering" the first newsletter hidden challenge!</p>
    <p>Don't worry, I will not be helping my team because that just wouldn't be fair. However, I think they're fully capable of solving all the questions with ease :P</p>
    <p>I'll start you guys off with an easy challenge since it's the first one.</p>
    <p>I would strongly recommend working with your team to solve each question. Even if it looks easy, you should always have others double-checking. And it doesn't look right if only one person is doing everything. Try to get everyone involved!</p>
    <p style="margin-top:30px"><strong>This challenge will test how well you know your current e-board.</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>This e-boarder is the one who creates the newsletter every week. <input type="text" id="answer1" class="answerInputs"></li>
        <li>Where is Annvie from? <input type="text" id="answer2" class="answerInputs"></li>
        <li>Name one of Anthony's hobbies. <input type="text" id="answer3" class="answerInputs"></li>
        <li>What is Dinh's major? <input type="text" id="answer4" class="answerInputs"></li>
        <li>Who are the two Co-Performance Coordinators? <input type="text" id="answer5" class="answerInputs"></li>
        <li>How tall is Kimberly? <strong>(Use format: <#FEET> ft. <#INCHES> in.)</strong> <input type="text" id="answer6" class="answerInputs"></li>
        <li>He's actually a K-pop star. <input type="text" id="answer7" class="answerInputs"></li>
        <li>What's <strong>MY</strong> email? <input type="text" id="answer8" class="answerInputs"></li>
    </ol>
    <p>When you have completed every question, enter your team's secret passphrase and click the 'Submit' button to send me your answers.</p>
    <p><strong>EACH TEAM ONLY GETS 1 SUBMISSION.</strong></p>
    <p>
        <strong>Once <i>anybody</i> on your team enters your team's secret passphrase and hits 'Submit', that is it. Any additional submissions will not be counted.</strong>
        <i style="font-size:10px">wow so strict</i>
    </p>
    <p>Buuuut for this first one, I haven't given you guys passphrases yet, so just enter your team name. Please don't enter another team's name in hopes of sabotaging them. We're all friends here!</p>
    <p id="passphraseP"><strong>Your team name:</strong><input type="text" id="passphrase" class="answerInputs"></p>
</form>
<p id="oneMoreThing">Enter your answer for Question 8 here. This is where your answers will be emailed to. You better hope you got the right answer LOL.</p>

     * I don't really care if you guys read the source code. You won't find anything that would

     * and if I agree that it's serious enough, maybe your team will get bonus points. Actually,
     * idk. I'll have to check with Kim about that.....
     * Also, it's really frustrating using WordPress. When I copied the code onto it, I had to make
     * so many changes to accommodate for all it's default styling. Ugh so annoying. I think I kinda
     * messed up some stuff on the page, but whatever. Last minute ftw!
